Question: What type of flow can be taken for granted in a pipe of a uniform cross-section?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . unsteady
1 . steady
2 . non-uniform
3 . uniform
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Description: According to the continuity equation, ?AV =constant, where ?= density, A= cross-sectional area of flow, V = velocity of flow. For a uniform cross-section pipe, no matter the flow rate, the velocity of flow inside the pipe will always remain constant. Hence, it'll always be a uniform flow. It'll be a steady flow if and only if the water level is maintained at a constant level by supplying water at the same rate as it gets discharged. Else the water level will keep decreasing with time leading to an unsteady flow.
