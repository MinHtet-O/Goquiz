Question: Which of the following statement is correct regarding the difference between TRUNCATE, DELETE and DROP command?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . i and iii
1 . ii and iii
2 . ii and iv
3 . ii and iv
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation:DELETE is used to remove existing records from the database. DELETE command is a DML statement so that it can be rolled back.DROP is used to delete the whole table, including its structure. DROP is a DDL command that lost the data permanently, and it cannot be rolled back.TRUNCATE is used to delete the whole records, but it preserves the table's schema or structure. TRUNCATE is a DDL command, so it cannot be rolled back.Hence, option A is the correct answer.

2 . i and iii
3 . ii and iv
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: Candidate key in SQL is a set of fields that identify each record in a table uniquely. It is a super key with no repeated fields that means the minimal super key is a candidate key. A table can contain multiple candidate keys, but it can have only a single primary key. Therefore option A is the correct choice.

Question: ______ is NOT a type of constraint in SQL language?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . foreign key
1 . primary key
2 . unique
3 . alternate key
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: ALTERNATE KEY is a key associated with one or more columns to identify each row in a table uniquely. If a table with one or more candidate keys, then the keys other than the primary key is an alternate key. Since the alternate key is a part of the candidate key, it is not a constraint in SQL. Hence, option D is the correct choice.
