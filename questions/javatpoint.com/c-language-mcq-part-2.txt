Question: Which of the following statement is correct about the C language?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . the c language is a binary language with some extra features.
1 . the c language is a high-level language with some low features.
2 . the c language is a mid-level language with some high features.
3 . the c language is a low-level language.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: C is considered a middle-level language because it supports the feature of both low-level and high-level languages. Today, many programmers refer to C as a low-level language because it lacks a large runtime system (no garbage collection, etc.). It supports only scalar operations and provides direct memory addressing.

Question: In the following program fragment, s and b are two integers:
CodeBlock:
b = s + b
s = b - s
b = b - s

Options:
0 . exchange the values of s and b
1 . transfer the values of s and b
2 . transfer the values of b and s
3 . add or subtract the values of s and b
4 .

Explanation: The intention of this program fragment is to exchange (swap) the values of s and b. Let us take an example for better understand:s = 1 
b = 2
b = s + b
b = 1 + 2 
b = 3           
s = b - s
s = 3 - 1
s = 2 
b = b - s
b = 3 - 2
b = 1

Question: Study the following program fragment
CodeBlock:
int i = 263;
putchar(i);

Options:
0 . prints 263
1 . prints the ascii equivalent of 263
2 . rings the bell
3 . prints garbage
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: 263 is equivalent to binary number 100000111. If the user tries to print an integer as a character, only the last 8 bits are considered, and the remaining ones are ignored. In this program, the ASCII value of 100000111 will be 00000111 (i.e., decimal 7). Therefore, this program will print "ringing the bell".
