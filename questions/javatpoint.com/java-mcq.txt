CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . bytecode is executed by jvm
1 . the applet makes the java code secure and portable
2 . use of exception handling
3 . dynamic binding between objects
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: The output of the Java compiler is bytecode, which leads to the security and portability of the Java code. It is a highly developed set of instructions that are designed to be executed by the Java runtime system known as Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Java programs executed by the JVM that makes the code portable and secure. Because JVM prevents the code from generating its side effects. The Java code is portable, as the same byte code can run on any platform.Hence, the correct answer is option (a).

Question: Which of the following is not a Java features?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . dynamic
1 . architecture neutral
2 . use of pointers
3 . object-oriented
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: The Java language does not support pointers; some of the major reasons are listed below:
One of the major factors of not using pointers in Java is security concerns. Due to pointers, most of the users consider C-language very confusing and complex. This is the reason why Green Team (Java Team members) has not introduced pointers in Java.
Java provides an effective layer of abstraction to the developers by not using pointers in Java.
Java is dynamic, architecture-neutral, and object-oriented programming language.Hence, the correct answer is option (c).

Question: What should be the execution order, if a class has a method, static block, instance block, and constructor, as shown below?
CodeBlock:
public class First_C {
      public void myMethod() 
	{
	System.out.println("Method");
	}
	
	{
	System.out.println(" Instance Block");
	}
		
	public void First_C()
	{
	System.out.println("Constructor ");
	}
	static {
		System.out.println("static block");
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	First_C c = new First_C();
	c.First_C();
	c.myMethod();
  }
} 

Options:
0 . instance block, method, static block, and constructor
1 . method, constructor, instance block, and static block
2 . static block, method, instance block, and constructor
3 . static block, instance block, constructor, and method
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: The order of execution is:
The static block will execute whenever the class is loaded by JVM.
Instance block will execute whenever an object is created, and they are invoked before the constructors. For example, if there are two objects, the instance block will execute two times for each object.
The constructor will execute after the instance block, and it also execute every time the object is created.
A method is always executed at the end.
Hence, the correct answer is an option (d).

Question: What will be the output of the following program?
CodeBlock:
public class MyFirst {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
         MyFirst obj = new MyFirst(n);
 }
 static int a = 10;
 static int n;
 int b = 5;
 int c;
 public MyFirst(int m) {
       System.out.println(a + ", " + b + ", " + c + ", " + n + ", " + m);
   }
// Instance Block
  {
     b = 30;
     n = 20;
  } 
// Static Block
  static 
{
          a = 60;
     } 
 }

Options:
0 . 10, 5, 0, 20, 0
1 . 10, 30, 20
2 . 60, 5, 0, 20
3 . 60, 30, 0, 20, 0
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: In the above code, there are two values of variable a, i.e., 10 and 60. Similarly, there are two values of variable b, i.e., 5 and 30. But in the output, the values of a and b are 60 and 30, respectively. It is because of the execution order of the program.The execution order of the program is that the static block executes first, then instance block, and then constructor. Hence, the JVM will consider the value of a and b as 60 and 30 concerning the execution order. The value of a = 10 and b = 5 are of no use. And the value of variables c and m is 0 as we have not assigned any value to them.Hence, the correct answer is an option (d).

Question: Which of the following is a valid declaration of a char?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . char ch = '\utea';
1 . char ca = 'tea';
2 . char cr = \u0223;
3 . char cc = '\itea';
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: A char literal may contain a Unicode character (UTF-16). We can directly use these characters only if our file system allows us, else use a Unicode escape (\u) such as "\u02tee". The char literals are always declared in single quotes (').The option b, c, and d, are not valid because:
In the option b), to make a String valid char literal, we should add prefix "\u" in the string.
In the option c), single quotes are not present.
In the option d), "\i" is used in place of "\u."
Hence, the correct answer is the option (a).

Question: Which of the following is a valid long literal?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . abh8097
1 . l990023
2 . 904423
3 . 0xnf029l
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: For every long literal to be recognized by Java, we need to add L character at the end of the expression. It can be either uppercase (L) or lowercase (l) character. However, it is recommended to use uppercase character instead of lowercase because the lowercase (l) character is hard to distinguish from the uppercase (i) character.For example,
Lowercase l: 0x466rffl
Uppercase L: 0nhf450L
Hence, the correct answer is an option (d).

Question: What does the expression float a = 35 / 0 return?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 0
1 . not a number
2 . infinity
3 . run time exception
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: In Java, whenever we divide any number (double, float, and long except integer) by zero, it results in infinity. According to the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754), if we divide 1/0 will give positive infinity, -1/0 will give negative infinity, and 0/0 will give NaN. But on dividing an integer by zero, it throws a runtime exception, i.e., java.lang.ArithmeticException.Hence, the correct answer is an option (c).

Question: What will be the output of the following program?
CodeBlock:
public class Test {
public static void main(String[] args) {
	int count = 1;
	while (count <= 15) {
	System.out.println(count % 2 == 1 ? "***" : "+++++");
	++count;
		}      // end while
	}       // end main 
 }

Options:
0 . 15 times ***
1 . 15 times +++++
2 . 8 times *** and 7 times +++++
3 . both will print only once
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: In the above code, we have declared count = 1. The value of count will be increased till 14 because of the while (count<=15) statement. If the remainder is equal to 1 on dividing the count by 2, it will print (***) else print (+++++). Therefore, for all odd numbers till 15 (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15), it will print (***), and for all even numbers till 14 (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) it will print (+++++).Hence, an asterisk (***) will be printed eight times, and plus (+++++) will be printed seven times.

Question: Which of the following creates a List of 3 visible items and multiple selections abled?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . new list(false, 3)
1 . new list(3, true)
2 . new list(true, 3)
3 . new list(3, false)
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: From the above statements, the new List(3, true) is the correct answer; this is because of the constructor type. To create a list of 3 visible items along with the multiple selections abled, we have to use the following constructor of the List class.List (int rows, boolean multipleMode): It creates a new list initialized to display the described number of rows along with the multiple selection mode. Therefore, in the statement new List (3, true), three (3) refers to the number of rows and true enables the multiple selections.Hence, the correct answer is option (b).

Question: Which of the following for loop declaration is not valid?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . for ( int i = 99; i >= 0; i / 9 )
1 . for ( int i = 7; i <= 77; i += 7 )
2 . for ( int i = 20; i >= 2; - -i )
3 . for ( int i = 2; i <= 20; i = 2* i )
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: The first option is not a valid declaration as i/9 is not declared correctly. The correct statement will be:
      for ( int i= 99; i>=0; i= i/9)Then the code would execute. But without assigning the value of i/9 to a variable, it would not execute, and an exception is thrown, as shown below.Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem:
      Syntax error on token "/", invalid AssignmentOperatorThe other three statements are valid and will execute. Hence, the correct answer is the option (a).

Question: What do you mean by nameless objects?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . an object created by using the new keyword.
1 . an object of a superclass created in the subclass.
2 . an object without having any name but having a reference.
3 . an object that has no reference.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: The nameless objects are basically referred to as anonymous objects. The anonymous objects do not have any names. We can also say that, when an object is initialized but is not assigned to any reference variable, it is called an anonymous object. For example, new Employee();.If we assign it to a reference variable like,Employee emp = new Employee();In the above code, emp is a reference variable. Therefore, the above object is not anonymous, as it is assigned to a reference variable.Hence, the correct answer is option (d).

Question: Which option is false about the final keyword?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . a final method cannot be overridden in its subclasses.
1 . a final class cannot be extended.
2 . a final class cannot extend other classes.
3 . a final method can be inherited.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: The final is a reserved keyword in Java that is used to make a variable, method, and class immutable. The important features of the final keyword are:
Using the final keyword with a variable makes it constant or immutable. We can't reassign the values of it.
A final variable must be a local variable and cannot be used in other classes.
Using the final keyword with a method makes it constant, and we can't override it in the subclass.
Using final with a class makes the class constant, and we cannot extend a final class. But a final class can extend other classes.
Hence, the correct answer is option (c).

CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . stack
1 . string memory
2 . heap memory
3 . random storage space
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: When a String is created using a new operator, it always created in the heap memory. Whereas when we create a string using double quotes, it will check for the same value as of the string in the string constant pool. If it is found, returns a reference of it else create a new string in the string constant pool.Hence, the correct answer is option (c).

Question: Which keyword is used for accessing the features of a package?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . package
1 . import
2 . extends
3 . export
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: The import keyword is used to access the classes and interfaces of a particular package to the current file. In other words, it is used to import the user-defined and built-in classes and interfaces into the source file of java so that the current file can easily access the other packages by directly using its name. For example,   import java.awt.*; 
   import java.lang.Object;
The first import statement imports all the classes and interfaces of java.awt package. Whereas, the second import statement only imports the Object class of the java.lang package.The package keyword is used to create a new package. The extends keyword indicates that the new class is derived from the base or parent class using inheritance, and export is not a keyword in Java.Hence, the correct answer is option (b).

Question: Which of the given methods are of Object class?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . notify(), wait( long msecs ), and synchronized()
1 . wait( long msecs ), interrupt(), and notifyall()
2 . notify(), notifyall(), and wait()
3 . sleep( long msecs ), wait(), and notify()
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: The notify(), notifyAll(), and wait() are the methods of the Object class. The notify() method is used to raise a single thread that is waiting on the object's monitor. The notifyAll() method is similar to the notify() method, except that it wakes up all the threads that are waiting on the object's monitor. The wait() method is used to make a thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify() or notifyAll() methods for an object.Hence, the correct answer is option (c).

0 . three reference variables and two objects are created.
1 . two reference variables and two objects are created.
2 . one reference variable and two objects are created.
3 . three reference variables and three objects are created.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: In the above code, there are three reference variables and two objects. The studentName, studentId, and stud_class are the three reference variables. The objects are those variables that are created using the new operator, i.e., studentName and stud_class. The studentId is only a reference variable as it is not declared using the new operator. Both studentName and stud_class are reference variables as well as objects.Hence, there are three reference variables and two objects.Hence, the correct answer is option (a).

Question: Which of the following is a mutable class in java?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . java.lang.string
1 . java.lang.byte
2 . java.lang.short
3 . java.lang.stringbuilder
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: A mutable class is a class in which changes can be made after its creation. We can modify the internal state and fields of a mutable class. The StringBuilder class is a mutable class, as it can be altered after it is created.The String, Byte, and Short are immutable classes as they cannot be altered once they are created.Hence, the correct answer is option (d).

Question: What will be the output of the following program?
CodeBlock:
abstract class MyFirstClass
{
     abstract num (int a, int b) {  }
}

Options:
0 . no error
1 . method is not defined properly
2 . constructor is not defined properly
3 . extra parentheses
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: Following are some rules for declaring an abstract method:
Abstract methods do not specify a method body, but they only have a method signature.
Abstract methods are always defined inside an abstract class.
In the above code, MyFirstClass is an abstract class. It contains an abstract method named num() that is not defined properly. According to the rules discussed above, an abstract method only has a method signature, not the method body.Hence, the correct answer option (b).

Question: What is meant by the classes and objects that dependents on each other?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . tight coupling
1 . cohesion
2 . loose coupling
3 . none of the above
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: In tight coupling, a group of classes and objects are highly dependent on each other. Tight coupling is also used in some cases, like when an object creates some other objects that are going to be used by them.Tight coupling is the correct answer as it is used when the logic of one class is called by the logic of another class.Hence, the correct option is (a).

Question: Given,
Find the value of value[i]?
CodeBlock:
int values[ ] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
for(int i=0;i< Y; ++i)
System.out.println(values[i]);

Options:
0 . 10
1 . 11
2 . 15
3 . none of the above
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: In the above code, we have not defined the variable Y. The code will not execute without any specific value for Y; it results in exception, as shown below.Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem:
        Y cannot be resolved to a variableSo, the values of i will not be printed, and the above exception is thrown.Hence, the correct answer is (d).

Question: Which of the following code segment would execute the stored procedure "getPassword()" located in a database server?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . callablestatement cs = connection.preparecall("{call.getpassword()}");
cs.executequery();
1 . callabledstatement callable = conn.preparecall("{call getpassword()}");
callable.executeupdate();
2 . callablestatement cab = con.preparecall("{call getpassword()}");
cab.executequery();
3 . callablestatement cstate = connect.preparecall("{call getpassword()}");
cstate.executequery();
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: In Java, java.sql.CallableStatement interface is used to call the SQL stored procedures in the database. The stored procedures are similar to functions as they perform some specific tasks, except that they are only available in the database. The CallableStatement can return either a single ResultSet object or multiple ResultSet objects.Hence, the correct answer is option (c).

Question: How many threads can be executed at a time?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . only one thread
1 . multiple threads
2 . only main (main() method) thread
3 . two threads
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: In Java, multiple threads can be executed at the same time. A Java standalone application always starts with a single thread known as the main thread that is associated with the main() method.In the operating system, only one thread is executed at a time.Hence, the correct answer is option (b).

Question: If three threads trying to share a single object at the same time, which condition will arise in this scenario?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . time-lapse
1 . critical situation
2 . race condition
3 . recursion
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: If two or more threads are trying to access a common resource at the same time. This situation is known as race condition. It generally occurs during the execution of multi-threaded application. It also refers to a programming bug or issue that occurs when the thread scheduler swaps the threads at any time between the process.Hence, the correct answer is option (c).

Question: If a thread goes to sleep 
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . it releases all the locks it has.
1 . it does not release any locks.
2 . it releases half of its locks.
3 . it releases all of its lock except one.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: The sleep() method does not release any locks of an object for a specific time or until an interrupt occurs. It leads to the poor performance or deadlock of threads. Whereas, the wait() method does not release the locks of an object.Therefore, when a thread goes to sleep, it does not release any locks.Hence, the correct answer is the option (b).

Question: Which of the following modifiers can be used for a variable so that it can be accessed by any thread or a part of a program?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . global
1 . transient
2 . volatile
3 . default
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: In Java, we can modify the values of a variable with the help of a reserved keyword known as volatile. It is a different way of making a class thread-safe. Thread-safe means that the methods and objects of a class are accessible by multiple threads at the same time.The volatile keyword is not a replacement of a synchronized block or method as it does not remove the need for synchronization among the atomic actions.Global is not a reserved keyword in Java. The transient and default are keywords in Java, but they are not used for accessing a variable by a thread from any part of the program.Hence, the correct answer is an option (c).

Question: What is the result of the following program?
CodeBlock:
public static synchronized void main(String[] args) throws
InterruptedException {
     Thread f = new Thread();
      f.start();
      System.out.print("A");
      f.wait(1000);
      System.out.print("B");
}

Options:
0 . it prints a and b with a 1000 seconds delay between them
1 . it only prints a and exits
2 . it only prints b and exits
3 . a will be printed, and then an exception is thrown.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: The InterruptedException is thrown when a thread is waiting, sleeping, or occupied. The output of the above code is shown below:A
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException
	at java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)
	at com.app.java.B.main(B.java:9)
In the above code, we have created a thread "f," and when started, A will be printed. After that, the thread will wait for 1000 seconds. Now, an exception is thrown instead of printing B. It is because the wait() method must be used inside a synchronized block or try-catch block unless it will throw an exception, as shown above.Hence, the correct option is option (d).

Question: In character stream I/O, a single read/write operation performs _____.
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . two bytes read/write at a time.
1 . eight bytes read/write at a time.
2 . one byte read/write at a time.
3 . five bytes read/ write at a time.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: There are two types of I/O stream. One is a byte stream, and the other is the character stream. The Byte stream is used to perform input or output 8-bit (equals to 1 byte) Unicode bytes whereas, the Character stream is used to read or write a 16-bit (equals to 2 bytes) Unicode character. Therefore, a single operation of character stream performs two bytes read/ write at a time.Hence, the correct answer is option (a).

Question: What is the default encoding for an OutputStreamWriter?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . utf-8
1 . default encoding of the host platform
2 . utf-12
3 . none of the above
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: The OutputStreamWriter class translates Unicode character into bytes by using the character encoding. The character encoding can be either a default encoding dependent on the system or encoding that is explicitly defined. If no external encoding is specified, it will use the default encoding of the host platform.Hence, the correct answer is option (b).
