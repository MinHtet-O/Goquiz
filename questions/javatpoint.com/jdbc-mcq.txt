Question: Which methods are required to load a database driver in JDBC?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . getconnection()
1 . registerdriver()
2 . forname()
3 . both b and c
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: There are two ways to load a database driver in JDBC:
By using the registerDriver() Method: To access the database through a Java application, we must register the installed driver in our program. We can do this with the registerDriver() method that belongs to the DriverManager class. The registerDriver() method takes as input a driver class, that is, a class that implements the java.sql.Driver interface, as is the case with OracleDriver.
By using the Class.forName() Method: Alternatively, we can also use the forName() method of the java.lang.Class to load the JDBC drivers directly. However, this method is valid only for JDK-compliant Java virtual machines. It is invalid for Microsoft JVMs.

Question: What should be the correct order to close the database resource?What should be the correct order to close the database resource?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . connection, statements, and then resultset
1 . resultset, connection, and then statements
2 . statements, resultset, and then connection
3 . resultset, statements, and then connection
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: The golden rule to JDBC connections and statements is to close in the reverse order of initiation or opening. In addition, the ResultSet is dependant on the execution of the Statement and the Statement is dependant on the Connection instance. Hence, the closing should occur in that order (ResultSet, Statement, and then Connection).

Question: Which of the following is not a type of ResultSet object?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . type_forward_only
1 . concur_write_only
2 . type_scroll_insensitive
3 . type_scroll_sensitive
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: There are three types of ResultSet object:
TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY: This is the default type and the cursor can only move forward in the result set.
TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE: The cursor can move forward and backward, and the result set is not sensitive to changes made by others to the database after the result set was created.
TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE: The cursor can move forward and backward, and the result set is sensitive to changes made by others to the database after the result set was created.
Based on the concurrency there are two types of ResultSet object.
CONCUR_READ_ONLY: The ResultSet is read-only, this is the default concurrency type.
CONCUR_UPDATABLE: We can use the ResultSet update method to update the rows data.

Question: How many ways to register a driver?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 2
1 . 3
2 . 4
3 . 5
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: There are four ways to register a driver:1. By creating an object of the Driver For example:sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver obj = new sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver();2. By sending the driver class object to the registerDriver() method of the DriverManager class. For example:DriverManager.registerDriver(new sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver());3. By sending the driver class name directly to the forName() For example:Class.forName("sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver");4. By using the getProperty() method of the System class. For example:String dname = System.getProperty("driver");
Class.forName(dname);If you are using the above method to register the driver, we should have to specify the driver's name at the time of running the program. The getProperty() method receives the driver name and stores the driver name in dname.We use the following command to provide the driver name at run time:c:\> java -Ddriver = driverclassname ProgramnameFor example:c:\> java -Ddriver = sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver MyProgram

Question: Are ResultSets updateable?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . yes, but only if we call the method opencursor() on the resultset and if the driver and database support this option.
1 . yes, but only if we indicate a concurrency strategy when executing the statement, and if the driver and database support this option.
2 . yes, but only if the resultset is an object of class updateableresultset and if the driver and database support this option.
3 . no, resultsets are never updateable. we must explicitly execute a dml statement to change the data in the underlying database.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: By default, a ResultSet object is not updatable and its cursor moves only in the forward direction. If we want to create an updateable ResultSet object, either we can use ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE or the ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE type, which moves the cursor forward and backward relative to the current position.
