CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . true
1 . false
2 .

This group is required for the ligation reaction to take place, such that at each end, two phosphates are required. But as soon as the phosphate groups are removed from the vector, its relegation becomes impossible. And since the insert still has a phosphate group, one of its strands will form the bond, enabling a ligation reaction to take place.
