There are two loops:L1 = -G1H1L2 = -G3H2Step 3: Two non-touching loops. There is only one combination of two non-touching loops, as shown below:L1 L2 = G3G1H1H2Step 4: Since there are no three non-touching loops, we will directly find the system's determinant.∆= 1 - (L1+ L2) + (L1L2)= 1 + G1H1 + G3H2 + G3G1H1H2Step 5: Here, we will find ∆1 because there is only one forward path.For ∆1, we will eliminate L1 and L2 because both loop gains are touching the forward path.L1 = L2 = 0∆1=1-0=1Now, the transfer function is obtained as: C/R = G1G2G3/ (1 + G1H1 + G3H2 + G3G1H1H2)Hence the correct answer is an option (a).

Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: Forward path is the path from the input to the output node in the given signal flow graph. Here, there are three forward paths.The number of loops in the given signal flow graph is three, as shown in the below image:The non-touching loops are considered as non-touching when there are no common nodes between them. There are no non-touching loops in the given signal flow graph. It is because all the loops touch each other.Hence, the correct answer is an option (c).

Explanation: The correct order to find the transfer function of the free body diagram is given below:The free-body diagram is created by drawing each mass separately and marking all the forces acting on the node. Write one differential equation for each of the free body diagram and take the Laplace transform and convert the differential equations into the algebraic equations. Rearrange the equations in the s-domain to find the output and input ratio by eliminating the unwanted variables. In this way, we can easily calculate the transfer function of the free body diagram.Hence, the correct answer is an option (b).
