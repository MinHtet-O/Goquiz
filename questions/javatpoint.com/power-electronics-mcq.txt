Question: The V-I characteristics of diode lie in the
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . first quadrant
1 . fourth quadrant
2 . the third and second quadrant
3 . the first and third quadrant
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: V- I characteristics of diode lies in the first and third quadrant. The first quadrant works in the forward region, and the third quadrant works in reverse biased mode.

Question: Find a triple frequency of a six-phase half-wave rectifier for 220 V 50 Hz input
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 150 hz
1 . 300 hz
2 . 50 hz
3 . 600 hz
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation:In a six-phase half-wave rectifier, usually six diodes are used. Since the supply frequency is 50 z, therefor the ripple frequency is six-time that of the power supply= 50 × 6 = 300 Hz

Question: If a firing angle α of a single phase fully controlled rectifier feeding a constant DC current into the load is 600, Find the displacement factor of the rectifier
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 0
1 . 0.5
2 . 1
3 . 1.5
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: Displacement factor refers to the power factor due to the phase shift between voltage and current at fundamental line frequency.SO,The displacement power factor is given as = Cos?? is 600Therefore, Cos600 = 0.5

Question: A forward-biased PN junction acts as a/an
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . thyristor
1 . closed switch
2 . amplifier
3 . chopper
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: PN junction diode refers to a diode that is formed when a p-type semiconductor is fused with an n-type semiconductor. It creates a potential barrier across the diode junction. In forward biasing conditions, the PN junction diode acts as a closed switch.

Question: For a specific transistor, if the value of beta is equal to 400 and the Base current is 8mA, Find the value of Emitter current?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 4.308
1 . 3.208 a
2 . 7.808 a
3 . 9.276 a
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation:Given,Current Gain β = 400Base current IB = 8mAThe dc current gain βdc refers to the collector current ratio to base current at constant VCE under dc biasing conditions.

Question: The two-transistor model of an SCR obtained by
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . bisecting the scrs diagonally
1 . bisecting the scrs top and bottom two layers
2 . bisecting the scrs only bottom two layers
3 . bisecting of scrs horizontally
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: The two-transistor models of an SCR are obtained by bisecting the SCRs top and bottom two layers. SCR is a unidirectional device that works like a diode. It enables current to flow in a single direction only.

Question: In an SCR, the gate cathode characteristics have a slope of 160. If the gate power dissipation is 0.8 watt, find the value of the gate current?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 110 ma
1 . 220ma
2 . 71 ma
3 . 31 ma
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation:Given,Slope = 160We know thatPower is defined as the product of voltage and currentTherefore,P = Vg× Ig = 0.8Slope Vg / Ig = 160Vg = 160 × Ig160 I2g = 0.8Ig = 71 mA
