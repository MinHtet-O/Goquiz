Question: Mach number is defined as
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . the ratio of a mass number to weight
1 . the ratio of characteristic velocity to velocity of sound
2 . the ratio of force to velocity
3 . the ratio of friction to acceleration
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: Mach number refers to a non-dimensional number in fluid mechanics which defines the velocity of the fluid with respect to the velocity of sound in air or any fluidic medium through which the body travels. In other words, we can say that it is the ratio of the velocity of the object to the speed of sound in air or vacuum. Consider an example to understand this concept, suppose an airplane travels at a speed of 420 m/s has a Mach number of 4, find the velocity of sound in air?Where, M = Mach numberC = speed of an objecta = Velocity of the sound in air or any fluidic mediumtherefore,

Question: The depth of flow in an alluvial channel is 2 m. If the critical velocity ratio is 1.5 and manning's n is 0.025, find the critical velocity of the channel as per Kennedy's method
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 1.28 m/sec
1 . 2.98 m/sec
2 . 7.26 m/sec
3 . 9.85 m/sec
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation:The depth of flow in a alluvial channel (y) = 2 mCritical velocity ratio (m) = 1.5manning's n = 0.025We know that, the velocity as per kennedy methodVo = 0.55 × m × (y) 0.64Vo = 0.55 × 1.5 × (2) 0.64= 1.28 m/sec

Question: If a soil has a liquid of 50 % and a plasticity index of 25 %, find the plastic limit of the soil?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 20 %
1 . 25%
2 . 40 %
3 . 50%
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation:Given;Liquid WL = 50 %Plasticity index Ip = 25 %Plastic limit Wp = ?We know that,Ip = WL - Wp25 % = 50 % - WpWp = 25 %

Question: A 40 m metric chain is found to be 0.2 m too short throughout the measurement. If the distance measured is recorded as 400 m, find the actual distance measured?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 523
1 . 669
2 . 398
3 . 989
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation:Given;Correct length of the chain (l) = 40 mWrong length of the chain (l') = 40 - 0.2 = 39.8 m.Wrong length og measured line (L') = 400mCorrect length of the measured line (L) = ?= L × l = l^'×L'= L ×40 = 39.8 × 400L = 398
