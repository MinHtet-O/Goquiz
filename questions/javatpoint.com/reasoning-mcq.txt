Question: Which number is wrong in the series 2, 6, 15, 31, 56, 93?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 6
1 . 31
2 . 56
3 . 93
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: In the given series, the difference between the numbers is the square of consecutive integers. That means the difference between 2 and 6 is 4 (22), 6 and 15 is 9 (32), 15 and 31 is 16 (42), 31 and 56 is 25 (52), so after 25 the difference should be 36 (62), but in the given series it is 37. So, after 56, the next number should be 92 to follow the sequence. But the number is 93 instead of 92. So, 93 is the wrong number.
