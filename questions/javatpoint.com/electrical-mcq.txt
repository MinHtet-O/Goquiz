Question: Which of the given motor has insufficient starting torque at full load speed with the same H.P. ratings?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . three-phase induction motor
1 . shunt motor
2 . synchronous motor
3 . differential compound motor
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: Differential compound motor has poor starting torque at full load speed with same H.P. ratings because its shunt fields restrict series field. The primary reason for the less starting torque than the motor is reduced field flux. The Dc compound motor is a type of self-excited motor, but it is a compound of both series and shunt field coils connected to the armature winding. A series field winding connected in series with the armature and a shunt field winding connected in parallel to the armature.

Explanation: The number of holes is equal to the number of electrons in an intrinsic semiconductor. Intrinsic semiconductor refers to a semiconductor whose electrical conductivity lies between conductor and insulator. The semiconductors are divided into two categories based on impurity, the first is an intrinsic semiconductor, and another is an extrinsic semiconductor. Intrinsic semiconductors are undoped semiconductors ( Zero impurities), so the number of free electrons is calculated by the material properties itself instead of impurities.

Question: In a ferromagnetic material, the neighboring atomic magnetic moments are
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . predominantly unequal in small regions of material.
1 . predominantly constant in small regions of material.
2 . predominantly unequal and parallel throughout the material.
3 . predominantly equal and parallel throughout the material.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: Ferromagnetic materials refer to those substances which show permanent dipole moment even in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field. They have their magnetic moments arranged parallel to the direction of the applied magnetic field by the orientation of the individual domains within the material towards the applied magnetic field.

Question: N-type and P-type extrinsic semiconductors are formed by adding the impurities of which valency.
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . tertavalent and pentavalent
1 . trivalent and pentavalent
2 . pentavalent and trivalent
3 . trivalent and tetravalent.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: Pentavalent impurity refers to an impurity that consists of 5 valance electrons and is shared with neighboring Si atoms, and the rest of the electrons is free to move that are responsible for conduction. It produces an electron as a majority charge carrier. Trivalent impurity refers to an impurity that consists of 3 valance electrons and is shared with neighboring Si atoms to produce a p types semiconductor by producing a hole as a majority charge carrier.
