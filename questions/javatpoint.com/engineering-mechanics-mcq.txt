3 . parallel
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Description: The concurrent forces are the axis of rotation. If any of the force touches that axis, that force is not considered insufficient to cause a rotation. If a force is concurrent, then the force's perpendicular distance from the axis line is zero, thus no rotation. As we know, rotation is caused by a moment.

Description: The forces need to be collinear. If they are not so, then the equilibrium is not possible. If they are parallel, too, then it is assumed that they are meeting in infinity. And hence the equilibrium is established between the forces. Thus the forces must be collinear.

Question: A couple of moment is developed when _______ of the attached member is prevented.
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . rotation
1 . translation
2 . subtraction
3 . addition
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Description: The development of the couple moment is when there is a prevention of the attached member's rotation. This is the basic condition for the equilibrium of the couple moments in any dimension. This rule is applied when the couple moments are taken into account for the equilibrium of the body.
