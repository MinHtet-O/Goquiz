Explanation: We can solve it via two ways. Let's see the ways.Shortcut method:We can also get the answer using the specified options. We can check the digits of the numbers mentioned in the options. As in the option 'C', there are 39 or 93, and on adding their digits, we will get 12, and on subtracting the digits, we will get 6.Detailed method:Suppose the digits of the two-digit number be 'a' and 'b'.So, according to the questiona + b = 12 ….(i)a - b = 6 ……(ii)Add equation (i) and (ii), we get2a = 18Or, a = 9Put a = 9 in eqn (i), we will getb = 3So, the two-digit number is 93 (when a > b)Or 39 (when b > a)

Question: If the three-fifth of a number is equal to 70% of another number, what is the ratio between the first number and second number?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 6 : 7
1 . 7 : 6
2 . 3 : 4
3 . 4 : 3
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: Let the numbers be a and b.So, according to the question,a * 3/5 = 70% of b3a/5 = 70b/100a/b = (70 * 5)/(100 * 3) = 7/6So, the ration between a and b is 7 : 6.

Question: If the sum of the cubes of three numbers is 4500, and their ratio is 1 : 2 : 3, what is the value of the smallest number between them?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 6
1 . 5
2 . 3
3 . 4
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: Given ratio is 1 : 2 : 3So, the numbers will be 1a : 2a : 3aThen, a3 + 8a3 + 27a3 = 450036a3 = 4500Or, a3 = 4500/36 =125So, a = 5The smallest number is 5.

Question: The denominator of a fraction is 3 more than its numerator. If the denominator is decreased by 2, and the numerator is increased by 7, we will get 2. What will be the sum of the numerator and denominator of that fraction?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 6
1 . 13
2 . 31
3 . 14
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: Let the numerator be 'a' so, denominator will be 'a + 3'.According to the question,(a + 7)/ ((a + 3) - 2) = 2/1(a + 7)/(a + 1) = 2/12a + 2 = a + 7=> a = 5So, the fraction is a/a + 3 = 5/ 5 + 3= 5/8And the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction is 13.

Question: Which of the following is the result of 1505 x 1505?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 2265015
1 . 2265035
2 . 2265025
3 . none of the above
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: Given: 1505 x 1505= 15052= (1500 + 5)2Apply formula; (a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab= 15002 + 52 + 2 *1500* 5= 2250000 + 25 + 15000= 2265025

Question: A boy has mistakenly multiplied a number by 45 instead of multiplying it with 25. Due to this, the answer was 200 more than the correct answer. What was the number?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 15
1 . 10
2 . 7
3 . none of the above
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: The required number = Increase in result/(wrong multiplier - correct multiplier)= 200/45 - 25= 10

Question: If a = (0.4)2, b = 0.04, and c = 2/5, then which of the following is the correct relationship between a, b, and c?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . c > a > b
1 . a > b > c
2 . a < b < c
3 . none of the above
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: a = (0.4)2 = 0.16b = 0.04c = 2/5 = 0.4So, the relationship is c > a > b.

Question: The sum of the numerator and denominator of a fraction is 11. If we add 2 to both numerator and denominator, the fraction will be increased by 1/24. What is the difference between the numerator and denominator of that fraction?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 1
1 . 2
2 . 6
3 . 8
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: Let the numerator of the fraction be x, so the denominator will be 11 - xSo, the fraction = x/11 - xOn adding 2 in both numerator and denominator, according to the question, the fraction will be -(x + 2)/(11 - x + 2) = (x)/(11 - x) + 1/24(x + 2)/(13 - x) - (x)/(11 - x) = 1/24[11x + 22 - x2 -2x - 13x + x2]/(13 - x) (11 - x) = 1/24After solving the above equation, we will get=> 528 - 96x = 143 - 24x + x2x2 + 72x - 385 = 0(x + 77) (x - 5) = 0So, x =5So, numerator = 5and, denominator = 11 - 5 = 6Difference between both is = 6 - 5 = 1
