Question: Which of the following is the correct output for the following JavaScript code:
CodeBlock:
functiondisplayArray(x)
{
varlen=x.length,i=0;
if(len==0)
console.log("Empty Array");
else
{
do
{
             console.log(x[i]);
} while (++i<len);
}
}

Options:
0 . prints the numbers in the array in the reverse order
1 . prints the numbers in the array in specific order
2 . prints "empty array"
3 . prints 0 to the length of the array
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: As we all know, the "do-while" statement creates a loop that runs at least once even if the given condition is not satisfied. This is because it runs for the first time before checking the condition, and then executes until the condition becomes false. Therefore, it traverses the array and prints the element of the array on the screen in a specific order.

Question: What are the three important manipulations for a loop on a loop variable?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . updation, incrementation, initialization
1 . initialization, testing, incrementation
2 . testing, updation, testing
3 . initialization, testing, updation
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: In the "For" loop statement, the Initialization, Testing, and Updating(and in the same order) are the most significant manipulations. First of all, the Initialization of the variable is done, then the condition gets tested, and after executing the code written in between curly braces, variable's value gets incremented.

Question: If the following piece of JavaScript code is executed, will it work if not, what kind of possible error can occur?
CodeBlock:
function fun(o)
{
for(;o.next; o =o.next);
return o;
}

Options:
0 . yes, it will work fine
1 . no, this will not iterate at all
2 . no, it will throw an exception as only numeric's can be used in a for loop
3 . no, it will produce a runtime error with the message "cannot use linked list"
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: In the above-given code, the For loop statement is used for traversing the linked list data structure, which returns the last element of the list. So it is definitely going to work without throwing any exception.

Question: What is the role of the "continue" keyword in the following piece of JavaScript code?
CodeBlock:
while (x !=0)
{
if(x ==1)
continue;
else
       x++;
}

Options:
0 . the continue keyword restarts the loop
1 . the continue keyword skips the next iteration
2 . the "continue" keyword breaks out of the loop
3 . it is used for skipping the rest of the statements in that particular iteration
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: The continue keyword does not get exit from the loop just like break keyword does. It skips the upcoming statements in that iteration form where it gets encountered, and instead of exiting the loop, it moves to the next iteration.

Question: Which one of the following is not considered as "statement" in the JavaScript?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . use strict
1 . debugger
2 . if
3 . with
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: In JavaScript, the "use strict" is not a keyword because it not includes any language keywords. However, it is a directive that is introduced in the ECMAscript5 version of the javascript. The "use strict" can be used only in the beginning of the script or in the beginning of the function where no actual keywords are mentioned yet.

Question: What if we define a "for" loop and it removes one of the properties that has not yet been enumerated?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . the removed property will be stored in a cache
1 . the loop will not run at all
2 . that property will be enumerated
3 . that specific property will not be enumerated
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: If the body of the "for" loop removes any of the property that has been not enumerated yet, normally that property not gets enumerated. If the object of the "for" loop statement creates a new property on the object, that property is usually not enumerated.

CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . ==operator
1 . equals() method
2 . === operator
3 . isprototypeof() method
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: The prototype is a kind of global property that is available with nearly all objects. In order to know about an object, whether the object is a prototype (or a part of a prototype chain) of another object, the user can use the "isPrototypeOf()" method. For example, if the user wants to find out about z whether it is a prototype of "s" or not, user can write z.isPrototypeOf(s).

a.shift();

Options:
0 . exception is thrown
1 . [4,5]
2 . [3,4,5]
3 . 5
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: In JavaScript, the "unshift()"," shift()" methods work like just as push() and pop() but with a slight change, unlike the push and pop the unshift(), unshift() both insert and remove a data item from the beginning instead of from the end of the array. The "unshift()" is used for inserting the data element/item in the beginning of the array while the "shift()" method shifts the data item to the beginning of the array from the higher index, empty the last index of the array and returns the updated length of the array.In the process of shifting, the data element is removed from the beginning of the array, and all subsequent elements are shifted and the new length of the array is returned.

1 . 5, 6, 7
2 . 4, 5, 6,
3 . 4, 5, 6, 7
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: The "slice()" method used in the above program a built-in function of the JavaScript and it is used to delete/remove the data items from the array. In general, it requires two arguments,in which first one for starting point and another one for the ending point. For example, consider the following given code:<script>
function myFunction() {
  var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Lemon", "Apple", "Mango"];
  var myBest = fruits.slice(-3, -1);
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myBest;
}
</script>OutputLemon,AppleHowever, we can see that in given question only one argument is passed, so it will definitely result in an error.

Question: Both the "rduucedRight()" and "reduce()" methods follow which one of the following common operation?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . inject and fold
1 . filter and fold
2 . finger and fold
3 . fold
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: In JavaScript, the reduce() method reduces the size of the array to a single value. This method executes a provided specific method on each data-item or element of the array in the left to right manner. It stored the value returned by the function in an accumulator. However, it does not execute the provided function on the array's elements, which has no value.The "reduceRigth()" method does the same work of reducing the array to a single individual value and calls or executes a certain function on each element of the array but in the right to left manner. It also stores the value returned by the function in an accumulator, such as total or result.So as we can see that both the methods "reduce()" and "reduceRight()" almost do the same work that is known as inject and fold.

Question: Which one of the following given task is performed by the "pop()" method of the array?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . itupdates the element of the array
1 . it increments the total length of the array by 1
2 . it prints the first element and made no impact on the length of the array
3 . updates the element removes one element of an array on each time the "pop()" function called
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: The "pop()" method is used for removing the last element of the array, or we can say, it removes/deletes the element from the tail-side of an array. Hence every time the "pop()" method is called, the value of the array's length gets decremented by one. 

 Index: 91
Question: What will happen if we use the "join()" method along with the "reverse()" method?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . it will reverse and concatenates the elements of the array
1 . it will reverse the element and store the elements in the same array
2 . it will just reverse the element of the array
3 . it will store the elements of the specified array in the normal order
4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: The "array.join()" method is one of the predefined methods of the JavaScript. It is used for joining the data-items of an array and converts them into a string. The "Reverse()" method, which is used along with it, reverses the specified array, and it stores the array into the memory once it gets reversed.

Options:
0 . var o= new object;
1 . var o;
2 . var o = object();
3 . object o=new object();
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: In JavaScript, as the only particular case of the "new" operator, the grammar is simplified by JavaScript by allowing the parentheses to be removed when there are no arguments passed in the function calling. So, user can neglect the empty pair of parentheses in every case of constructor invocation, in which there are no arguments.

x.reset()
x.count()
y.count()

Options:
0 . null
1 . 0
2 . 2
3 . undefined
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: The "counter()" method used in the above code made increment in the value of the variable by one each time it is called, and the" reset()" function resets the value of that variable to zero. Therefore if we look carefully, we can see that on variable "y" the "counter()" method was called two times, and the "reset()" method was not called even for one time, so the value of the variable y will be 2.

Question: Which one of the following can be considered as the opposite approach of the Lexical Scoping?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . dynamic scoping
1 . literal scoping
2 . static scoping
3 . generic scoping
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: The dynamic scoping can be considered as the opposite approach to the lexical scoping. In the dynamic scoping, it does not matter that how the code is written but what matters is how's the code executes. At the time of execution of every new function, a new scope associated with it gets pushed onto the stack and this scope normally stored along with the function call stack.At that point, when a variable is referenced in a function's definition, the scope is immediately checked in every call stack to know if it returns a value.
