Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: The Ward Leonard system was implemented and used to control the speed of DC shunt electric motors. Previously, it was quite convenient to obtain a variety of speeds and reversing for industrial applications. The system consisted of any prime mover, including an AC motor driving a DC shunt generator. The armature of the DC generator was directly connected to the shunt motor's armature to be controlled. The DC motor had its magnetic field continuously excited while that of the DC generator, the magnetic field could be controlled in intensity and direction. As the prime mover rotated, the field of the DC generator was adjusted as required, hence its armature current-controlled, this current would be adjusted in magnitude and direction, and this, being fed to the armature of the DC motor, would create a driving torque as it reacted with the continuously applied motor field.

Options:
0 . the diode behaves like a thyristor.
1 . the diode behaves like a resistor.
2 . the diode is destroyed.
3 . the diode behaves like a tunnel diode.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: PIV stands for Peak Inverse Voltage. In other words, PIV is defined as the maximum voltage that can apply to a diode in the reverse direction. Applying higher voltage will cause the diode to destroy. Start conducting current in the normally "OFF" direction, which will damage the diode and often do things you don't like to your circuit. The exact details depend on the circuit design.We usually select the PIV larger than the largest normal reverse operating voltage in our circuit. If you are making a full-wave rectifier for 220 Vac, you'd typically select a diode with a 240 or more PIV to give some "head room" and "safety factor" on the diode. The minimum should usually be selected like this: round-up from your designed or simulated reverse voltage to the next higher PIV for a diode family that gives you the current you require.

Question: A register can be defined as
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . the group of transistors for storing n- a bit of information
1 . the group of transistors for storing two bits of information
2 . the group of flip-flops for storing n bit of information
3 . the group of flip-flops for storing binary information.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: An electronic register refers to a form of memory that uses a group of flip-flops that is suitable for storing binary information, such as a byte (8 bits) of data. Each flip flop is a binary cell suitable for storing individual bits of a binary word. The length of the stored binary information depends on the number of flip-flops that make up the register. The information in a register can be transferred form one flip-flop to another flip-flop.

Question: What is the main function of the filter in a rectifier circuit?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . maximize ac input variations
1 . to suppress odd harmonics.
2 . remove ripples from the rectified output.
3 . minimize dc input and ac output variations.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation:The main function of the filter in a rectifier circuit is to remove ripples from the rectified output. As we know, rectifiers are primarily used to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). There we find a considerable AC component in the output, which is called ripple.Many electronic systems require pure direct current supply to drive or power them. To make a efficient continuous power supply that gives pure DC output, we need to remove the AC component from the output of rectifiers.

Question: What is the actual meaning of the parallel load of a shift register?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . all flip-flops are set with data.
1 . it means a parallel shifting of data.
2 . all flip-flops are present with data.
3 . each flip flop is loaded with data simultaneously.
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: The actual meaning of the parallel load of a shift register is all flip-flops are present with data. It means that all of the register stages are loaded at a time with new data bits by a single load pulse. In the present condition, the outputs of flip flops will be 1. The value of Preset equals 1 means Q equals 1, this the value of the input is definitely 1.

Question: A series of equal space time pulses may be easily generated by which type of counter circuit?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . johnson shift
1 . clock shift
2 . binary shift
3 . ring counter
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: A series of equally spaced timing pulses may be easily generated in clock shifts. In the Ring counter, the output of the last flip flops is connected to the first flip flop input, i.e., the ring counter is the cascaded connection of flip flops. It means feedback of the output of the flip-flops is fed to the input of the same flip-flop. It generates equally spaced timing pulses.

Question: What are the three output conditions of 3- state buffer?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . high impedance, 0, float
1 . negative, positive, 0
2 . 1, low impedance, float
3 . high, low, float
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: The three or tri-state conditions of a three-state buffer are High, Low, and float. A three-state buffer refers to a state buffer that' output can be made high impedance in addition to high or low logic states. It is useful in a condition where you have more than one output on a given line. For example, a multi-drop communication bus. If the 3-state control input is 1, then output is electrically isolated/disconnected or floated. It is as if a very high impedance of 10 Megaohms is inserted between the output pin and internal circuit. Now output pin can be set to 0 or 1 by any other output signal connected to the output.

Question: If a transistor has IC = 110 mA and IE = 55 mA, find the value of ฮฒ?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 1
1 . 7
2 . 9
3 . 11
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation:In common emitter, the term ฮฒ stands for current gain. Current gain refers to the ratio between collector current and base current at a constant VCE.ฮฒ = IC/IBIn the common base, DC gain ฮฑ refers to the ratio of the collector current IC and the emitter current IE.The equation of dc current gainฮฑ = IC/IENow, we can establish the relationship between ฮฑ and ฮฒฮฒ = ฮฑ/ (1 - ฮฑ)GivenEmitter current IE = 55 mACollector current IC = 110 mAฮฑ = IC/IE = 110/55 = 2ฮฒ = ฮฑ/ (1 - ฮฑ) = 2/ (1 - 2)ฮฒ = -2Here the negative value of ฮฒ indicates its direction, because by convention positive current is always termed as flowing into the device. So, the current gain is negative.
