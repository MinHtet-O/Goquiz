Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: Open circuit test is performed to find the core loss in the transformer. In this test, the transformer's secondary winding is kept open-circuited, and a wattmeter is connected to the primary side. An ammeter (Used to measure the current) is connected in series with the transformer's primary winding, and rated voltage is applied at the primary side.If normal voltage is applied at the primary side, flux is induced, and iron loss will occur. Hence the iron loss is maximum at rated voltage, and it is measured by using the wattmeter.

CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . reduce copper loss
1 . minimize eddy current loss

Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: When a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, a magnetic flux is induced and travels through the core of a transformer from primary to the secondary winding. During this process, some unwanted current is produced in the core of the transformer, usually known as eddy current, which is a primary cause of heat losses in the core. So, the transformer core is laminated to reduce the unwanted current (eddy current) and heat loss.

The primary side of the two identical transformers is connected in parallel across the supply voltage. In contrast, the secondary side of the transformer is connected in series in such a way that emf's are in series opposition. It is a method for determining the efficiency, voltage regulation and heading under loaded conditions of the transformer.

1 . cooling fan
2 . magnetostriction in an iron core
3 . all of the above
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: The noise of the transformer, also called humming, is mainly due to two reasonsMagnetostriction: Magnetostriction refers to the expansion and contraction of the laminations (iron core) due to the magnetic effect of the current flowing the coil of the transformer. Magnetostriction may be controlled, but it can't be totally removed depending on the transformer's design.Stray magnetic fields: Generally, the steel used in the transformer core and wire used in the transformer coil vibrating at 50 Hz to 60 Hz frequency because of the interaction of the magnetic fields.

Question: If a transformer is connected to a direct current supply, what happened?
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . damage the transformer
1 . no effect
2 . operate with low frequency
3 . operate with high frequency
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: As we know, a transformer works on the principle of mutual induction, where you need a dynamic magnetic field to generate an induced emf in the secondary winding. In direct current supply, the change in frequency with respect to time is null, which means the dc supply can't produce a dynamic magnetic field; hence mutual induction can't possible on direct current supply since the primary winding of the transformer has a very low value of resistance so it can't oppose the excessive flow of current; therefore, the current having high value can damage the windings.

CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . reduce core reluctance
1 . reduce core loss
2 . reduce copper winding

Explanation: Cruciform shape is used in transformer core to reduce core loss, copper, in the winding, reduce core reluctance, and reduction of iron and copper losses. In a transformer, eddy current losses in the iron core are directly proportional to the core's thickness. To reduce eddy current loss, we usually use thin sheets of the iron core to reduce skin effect.

CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . current

Correct Answer: 1

Explanation: The transformer is a static (no moving parts) device, so the rate of magnetic flux change is constant for a certain operation. The moving flux in the transformer core is cut by the coils whose frequency is controlled by the primary supply. Since the coils or stationary conductors are static, the frequency does not change.

Question: In the transformer, the function of a conservator is to
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . protect the transformer form damage when oil expands due to heating.
1 . it provides air for cooling the transformer.
2 . it provided colling oil to transformer when transformer needed.
3 . none of the above
4 . 
Correct Answer: 0

Explanation: In the transformer, the conservatory provides free space for the expansion of the oil. When the transformer is on full load, the oil heats up and expands. When the load is reduced from the transformer, oil temperature shrinks and oil contracts. Here, the air space in the conservatory enables breathing when oil expands or contracts. It is possible to manufacture a transformer without a conservator, but in that particular case, a tank with a gas cushion is required at the top of the transformer.

Options:
0 . eddy current loss = iron loss
1 . hysteresis loss = copper loss.

Explanation: The Efficiency of the transformer refers to the ratio of useful power output to the input power, the two being measured in the same unit. Its unit is either in Watts (W) or Kilowatt (KW). Transformer efficiency is denoted by Ƞ. Therefore, the efficiency of the transformer is maximum when iron loss = copper loss.

CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . high voltage side
1 . low voltage side
2 . primary side
3 . both option a and b
4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: The tapings can be placed either on high voltage (HV) or low voltage (LV) windings.Usually, the tapings are provided on high voltage (HV) winding due to the following reasons-Good voltage regulation is possible with high voltage winding as it carries a large number of turns.The low voltage winding of the transformer carries more current. So, if tapings are provided on the low voltage side, there are difficulties experienced in the interruption of high currents, making it unworkable. Hence, it is convenient to provide tapings on high voltage (HV) winding.

4 . 
Correct Answer: 3

Explanation: The short circuit test is performed to find the copper loss in the transformer. It is done by shorting the low voltage terminal and applying a low voltage across the high voltage terminal (because the current in the high voltage terminal will be less and simple to handle) and connect a wattmeter to measure the power dissipated in the low voltage terminal. The wattmeter reflects the full load copper loss.

Question: The flashpoint of transformer oil must be greater than
CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . 100 degree
1 . 125 degree
2 . 140 degree
3 . 160 degree
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: Usually, transformer oil has excellent insulating properties so that it is capable of withstanding high temperature. The Flashpoint of a transformer refers to the lowest temperature at which transformer oil gives vapor. Its primary function is to determine the self-ignition temperature of oil for safety reasons. The flashpoint of the transformer is directly proportional to the safe operation of the transformer. It means the higher the flash point value safer the operation. If the flash point value is lower than the specified value, the risk of fire in the transformer increases.

CodeBlock:

Options:
0 . magnetically coupled

Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: Auto-transformers is a transformer with one common winding for primary and secondary, wound on a common core.If you have a winding with a minimum of one tapping, you have an autotransformer. One extreme terminal in common for input and output. Two terminals are used for input, usually supply voltage, while the third terminal gives output with a common terminal. It is even possible to have more than one output.In Auto Transformer, one single winding is used for primary winding and secondary winding, which means the primary and secondary windings have the common single winding. Therefore, the primary is electrically connected to the secondary and magnetically coupled to it.Such an autotransformer saves on the cost of copper, and losses are less; flux linkage is better since there is just one winding. It is also smaller in size compared with a normal transformer.
