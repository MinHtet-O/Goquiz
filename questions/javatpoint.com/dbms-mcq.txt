2 . specialization
3 . all of the above
4 . 
Correct Answer: 2

Explanation: In specialization, the top-down approach is used, and it is apposite to the generalization.In the specialization, the higher-level entity can be divided into sub lower entities. It is generally used for identifying the subset of an entity set which share the distinguishing characteristics.To understand it more clearly, consider the following example:Suppose you have an entity, e.g., A vehicle. So through the specialization, you can be divided further into sub-entities like two-wheelers and four-wheelers. Therefore the correct answer is C.

4 . 
Correct Answer: 1

Explanation:The bottom-up approach is used in the generalization. The several lower-level sub-entities are grouped together to make an individual higher-level entity. In short, we can say that it is totally the opposite of specialization. To understand it more clearly, consider the following example:ExampleSuppose you have several lower entities like bus, car, motorbike etc. So, in order to make a more generalize (or higher level ) entity, you can combine them under a new higher-level entity such as a vehicle.
